# RunToYou

“Run to You” is story of a boy returning to his home after years abroad, only to find his country sieged by a neighboring nation and his best friend, who he hasn’t seen in years, missing. Believing that his friend to be still alive, the boy scours the city for her, running through a raging war. As he makes his way across the war-torn landscape, he is forced to reconcile with his past, and the things he ran away from.

This is a short technical demo of the game, built in Unity, to test the various mechanics of the game. Most of the art in the demo is created by myself.
